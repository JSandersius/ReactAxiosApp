API calls in react 
Originally we learned how to make API calls using AJAX which is part of JQuery 
Since Query is usually used for DOM manipulation and React uses a virtual DOM we genereally should'nt be using these together 
How to make an API call without AJAX?  

Devs have developed a great way to work around this
AXIOS is an npm package that works similarly to AJAX without JQuery 

We're going to use yarn instead of npm because yarn is a much faster and more consistent tool 

When installing a new package with yarn the package is stored locally
so the next time you install that  package in another application 
you dont have to download it online again 
by doing so yarn is able to take advantage of offline caches
	this is one the biggest advantages to yarn because it puts less strain on the netowork and allows you to install packages faster and more efficiently

we use yarn to install axios --> yarn add axios 
--> add bootstrap link to index.html in the puclic folder 

open the omdb container component and add three methods 

compenent did mount 
handle input change 
handle form submit 
 
componentDidMount() {  is one of reacts life cycle methods 
	the is a method that is triggered right after this component has loaded
	if we were to query a search before this compenent mounts the application would be slowed down beacause it would be waiting for a reasonse before it finishes loading 

Google --> react life cycle 
react documenatation 

in this method we're going to be utilizing the search movies method which is already there but commented out  

what the search movies method is doing is using a seperate method within the Api.js file called "search" with the query parameter 

-> now that search function is working properly, let's add the input change and search function 

the handle input change method is the same as we're done before 
	we're going to be updating the search property  of state with whatever is the current value of the search bar

handle form submit will then trigger the search movies function with whaterver is the current value of search in state
