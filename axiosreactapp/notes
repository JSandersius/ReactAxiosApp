API calls in react 
Originally we learned how to make API calls using AJAX which is part of JQuery 
Since Query is usually used for DOM manipulation and React uses a virtual DOM we genereally should'nt be using these together 
How to make an API call without AJAX?  

Devs have developed a great way to work around this
AXIOS is an npm package that works similarly to AJAX without JQuery 

We're going to use yarn instead of npm because yarn is a much faster and more consistent tool
