API calls in react 
Originally we learned how to make API calls using AJAX which is part of JQuery 
Since Query is usually used for DOM manipulation and React uses a virtual DOM we genereally should'nt be using these together 
How to make an API call without AJAX?  

Devs have developed a great way to work around this
AXIOS is an npm package that works similarly to AJAX without JQuery 

We're going to use yarn instead of npm because yarn is a much faster and more consistent tool 

When installing a new package with yarn the package is stored locally
so the next time you install that  package in another application 
you dont have to download it online again 
by doing so yarn is able to take advantage of offline caches
	this is one the biggest advantages to yarn because it puts less strain on the netowork and allows you to install packages faster and more efficiently
